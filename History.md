## History of Computers

> 1940s (Usage of Vacuum Tubes)

> 1960s (Introduction of eletric transistors to route electrons)

> 1963 (Introduction of integrated circuits, magnetic disks, and punch cards)
* Punch cards `acted as an OS` 
* When operating systems and punch cards were introduced, the roles of the programmer and the operator became distinct. The programmer was responsible for writing code, while the operator handled the physical input and output of punch cards, and later, the operation of the computer systems.
* IBM/360 was a compatible device back then

## Development of OS

#### MAC
> `MAC (Maths and Computation)` Project was introduced to spearhead a resource-timesharing system which would allow multiple users to access hardware & software resources from multiple locations

#### MULTICS (Multiplexed Information & Computing Service)
> Started in 1969 as an improvement on MAC
* Besides time-sharing system, introduced added features such as file-sharing/management, system security 
* `Multiplexing` - sends multiple information over a single communication link in a single complex signal
* Multiplexing allows for `sharing of same resource` across multiple users
* Spearheaded by `Bell Labs` and `General Electric`

#### UNIX
> Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (engineers of Bell Lab) found that the `MULTICS` system was too cumbersome and complex. They decided to develop their own single-user OS system in 1969 using the DAC PD7 processor and named it `UNICs` and created using the `B programming language`

> 1970: This was later improved upon and renamed to `UNIX` and significant changes were made to the `B language`, later on renamed as `new B` and `eventually C` that we all know today

> 1978: Dennis Ritchie and another partner at Bell Labs (Brian something) launched their own book `The C programming language`

> 1983: Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie were awarded the `Turing award`, the most prestigious award for their work in computer science

## GNU (GNU is not UNIX)
> 1983: Richard Stallman at IMT launched a propositon called `GNU` which is a free and open collaborative project to develop & provide software that would be compatible with `UNIX`.

> 1989: Richard Stallman acquired the `GNU Public License` which states that anyone would be able to create and add modifications to the project as he seeked a open software development cause

## LINUX
> 1991: Linus Torvald, who then graduated from University of Helsinski was not happy at the fact that in order to make use of GNU resources, one would have to use UNIX. This was because UNIX was incorporated under `Bell Labs` and required licenses to be used, meaning people would have to pay to use the UNIX operating system

> As he was frustrated, in `Aug 25 1991`, Linus announced to the community that he would develop a free OS system for fun which would not be as complex as `UNIX` but gets the work done.

> 1992: Many developers who developed software on GNU incorporated their works into `Linux` and eventually Linux's 1st distribution was released with a variety of GNU tools such as editors and compilers.

> 1993: By 1993, Linux had amassed almost 100 developers & released more distributions, with `Debian` being one of the notable distributions

> End 1990s: Many notable hardware manufacturers such as `IBM, Dell, HP` announced that they had created hardware that would be compatible with LINUX

> 2000s To Present: Linux became the main OS to operate web servers and has since become the main OS in many softwares and other OS distributions.
